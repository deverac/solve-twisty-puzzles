  <h2>Cube Anatomy</h2>
  <h3><a name='anatomy' id="anatomy">Anatomy of a cube</a></h3>
  <p>A cube can use any colors for the six faces. A common North American color scheme
  is: top face is white, bottom face is yellow, right face is red, left face is orange,
  front face is green, back face is blue. The colors will always be in the same position
  relative to each other. It is not possible to solve the cube in such a way that (e.g.)
  the yellow and white faces are next to each other.</p>

      The colors always have the same position relative to each other.

  <p>The cube is composed of three types of parts: Centers, Edges, and Corners. If a
  3x3x3 cube were to be disassembled, it would produce 21 pieces. Twelve pieces would be
  Edges, eight pieces would be Corners, and one (large) piece would connect all six
  Centers.</p>

      The cube has eight corner-cubies.

  </div>
  <p>Every center-cubie has a single color on it. Every edge-cubie has two colors on it.
  Every corner-cubie has three colors on it. The colors of a center-cubie, edge-cubie,
  or corner-cubie never change.</p>
  <p>Center-cubies can rotate, but never move about the cube; they are fixed in
  position. Edge-cubies and corner-cubies move about the cube. Every edge-cubie and
  every corner-cubie has one, and only one, home position. Once a cubie is in its home
  position it may be oriented correctly, or oriented incorrectily.</p>

  <p>Solving the cube means moving all cubies to their home position and orienting them
  correctly.</p>
  <p>There are six faces on the cube. Each face may be turned clockwise or
  counter-clockwise. The direction is determined when looking directly at the face to be
  turned. Singmaster notation is commonly used to refer to the six faces of the cube.
  F=Front, B=Back, L=Left, R=Right, U=Up, D=Down. A single letter (e.g. F) means to turn
  the face a quarter-turn clockwise. A letter followed by an apostrophe (e.g. F') means
  turn the face a quarter turn counter-clockwise.</p>

  <p>A letter followed by an integer (e.g. F2) indicates the number of quarter-turns
  that should be applied to the face. F2 is exactly the same as F F which is exactly the
  same as F' F'. Letters can be grouped by placing parenthesis around them. A group
  followed by an integer, indicates the number of times that the group should be
  repeated. (F B)3 is exactly equivalent to (F B F B F B).</p>
