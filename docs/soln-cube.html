  <h2>Solve a 3x3x3 cube</h2>
  <p>This page describes a method of solving a 3x3x3 cube.</p>
  <p>This solution requires freely re-orienting the cube during the solve. This is
  unlike the typical beginner's method which holds the cube in a fixed orientation.</p>

  <h3><a name='introduction' id="introduction">Introduction</a></h3>
  <p>Many methods have been devised to solve a 3x3x3 cube. Methods have been designed
  for <a href='https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page'>speed</a>,
  <a href='https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/fmc-fewest-move-count-challenge-method-tips/'>

  and more. The intent of this method is to provide an intuitive solution to solving the
  cube. When given a scrambled cube, most people are able to solve a single face without
  any help. They do so by observing how the cube is affected when a face is turned and
  then applying what they learn in order to complete a face. It is hoped that this
  solution will provide insight so that the whole cube can be solved in a similar
  manner.</p>
  <p>The typical beginner's method for solving a cube has several move-sequences (a.k.a.
  <i>algorithms</i> in cubing terminology) that must be memorized. The move-sequences
  are relatively short, but there is no apparent logic for why the move-sequences were
  chosen or how they work. This results in a situation where the cube is directing the
  solve and the human is just a Mechanical Turk that must carry out a series of
  seemingly arbitrary face-turns. If the human executes the face-turns correctly, the
  cube will be moved into a new state which will dictate a different series of seemingly
  arbitrary face-turns that must be used. This will continue until the cube is solved.
  To some degree, this process is true for every method of solving the cube, including
  this one. The difference is that this method provides a 'tool' for manipulating the
  cube in a useful manner. It is up to the human to apply the 'tool' in various ways to
  solve the cube. This allow the human to tell the cube what to do, rather than the cube
  telling the human what to do.</p>
  <p>As with every solution, there are advantages and disadvantages.</p>
  <p><b>Advantages:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Understandable</b>. The goal is to solve the cube in a reasoned manner.</li>
    <li><b>Buildable</b>: New move-sequences build on earlier move-sequences.</li>
    <li><b>Conjugate-free</b>: 'Setup' and 'teardown' moves are not required, but can be
    used.</li>
    <li><b>Eager</b>: The hard work is done first, which makes solving later stages
    almost trivial.</li>
    <li><b>Mono-move</b>: A single move-sequence is used. No left, right, or mirrored
    move-sequences are needed.</li>
    <li><b>Forgiving</b>: The cube can often be returned to its starting state simply by
    repeating a move-sequence.</li>
    <li><b>One-handed</b>: The solution can be performed using one hand without too much
    difficulty.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Disadvantages:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Slow</b>: A solve takes about eight minutes.</li>
    <li><b>Repetitive</b>. The solution uses the same four-turn move-sequence over, and
    over, and over.</li>
    <li><b>Topless</b>: There is no fixed top. The entire cube must be re-oriented
    multiple times during the solve.</li>
    <li><b>Speckled</b>: Edge-cubies and corner-cubies are positioned without orienting
    them. This results in a jumble of colors which makes it difficult to locate cubies
    or identify the state of the cube.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In most examples, especially in the beginning stages, cubies are shown correctly
  oriented in their home positions. This is only done for the sake of clarity. When
  solving a real cube the cubies will almost never be oriented as depicted.</p>
  <p>Many examples animate turning the layers of a cube. In all animations, the act of
  re-orienting the cube is never shown. Instead, the cube is held stationary and
  different faces are turned as if the cube were re-oriented. When solving a real cube,
  it is usually easier to physically re-orient the cube and turn the Front and Right
  faces, rather than hold the cube stationary and turn different faces. Either method
  will work.</p>
  <p>If you are unfamiliar with the cube, it may help to <a href='soln-cube.html'>learn
  about it</a>.</p>
  <p>The cube will be solved in four steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Move all eight corner-cubies to their home positions, ignoring their
    orientation.</li>
    <li>Move all twelve edge-cubies to their home positions, ignoring their
    orientation.</li>
    <li>Orient all twelve edge-cubies.</li>
    <li>Orient all eight corner-cubies.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>A 'tool' will be used to help solve the cube. The 'tool' is a four-turn sequence
  named <i><a href='soln-hs.html'>HedgeSlammer</a></i>. For this guide, the HedgeSlammer
  should be thought of as a single, indivisible move. Once a HedgeSlammer has begun,
  nothing else should happen until the HedgeSlammer is complete.</p>
  <p>When solving a cube, if a wrong face is turned, or if a face is turned the wrong
  direction, there are two ways to correct the error. One way to correct the error is to
  un-turn the face. The other way to correct the error is to turn the face three more
  times. Both methods will return the face to exactly the same state it was in prior to
  the incorrect face turn.</p>
  <p>Similarly, if you accidentally apply HedgeSlammer too many times, or start a
  HedgeSlammer in the wrong place, there are two ways to correct the error. One way to
  correct the error is to reverse every unintented turn that was made. The HedgeSlammer
  is a simple move-sequence, so reversing it is not too difficult. The other way to
  correct the error is to continue applying HedgeSlammers until a total of six
  HedgeSlammers have been applied. Applying six HedgeSlammers in a row will return the
  cube to its starting state. In other words, applying six HedegSlammers accomplishes
  exactly the same thing as doing nothing.</p>
  <p>A HedgeSlammer can be applied to any two faces that intersect, regardless of the
  orientation of the cube. To perform a HedgeSlammer, first choose any two faces that
  intersect, then turn the first face clockwise, then turn the second face
  counter-clockwise, then un-turn the first face (i.e. turn it counter-clockwise), then
  un-turn the second face (i.e. turn it clockwise). Prior to applying a HedgeSlammer, it
  is usually easier to reorient the cube so that the first face that is turned is the
  Front face and the second face that is turned is the Right face.</p>
  <p>It is technically possible to solve the cube using nothing but HedgeSlammers along
  with a total of three additional quarter-turns of a face. The three quarter-turns are
  needed to position the corner-cubies correctly. Once the eight corner-cubies are in
  their home positions, the remainder of the solve can be accomplished using nothing
  other than HedgeSlammers; no additional face turns are required. The method for doing
  so is not covered here.</p>
  <p>The HedgeSlammer move-sequence (F R' F' R) has a mirror move-sequence (R' F R F')
  named <i>SledgeHammer</i>. The SledgeHammer could also be used to solve the cube, but
  minor adjustments would need to be made. For example, if SledgeHammer were used,
  edge-cubies would cycle in the opposite direction, and corner-cubies would twist in
  the opposite direction. This guide will only use HedgeSlammer and will never use
  SledgeHammer.</p>
  <h3><a name='positioncorners' id="positioncorners">Position corner-cubies</a></h3>
  <p>The cube has eight corner-cubies - four in the top layer and four in the bottom
  layer - that must be moved to their home positions. The orientation of the
  corner-cubies when they are in their home positions is not important.</p>
  <p>Choose any face of the cube and orient the cube to make that face the top layer.
  During the process of moving corner-cubies to their home locations, the top layer will
  never change. However, in later stages of the solve, the top layer will frequently
  change.</p>
  <p>Move three three corner-cubies to their home positions in the top layer using any
  method you desire. (If the top layer already contains the four corner-cubies in their
  home locations, then move any one of the corner-cubies into the bottom layer. After
  doing so, ensure the other three corner-cubies in the top layer are in their home
  positions.)</p>
  <p>Rotate the bottom layer so that the fourth corner-cubie is directly below its home
  position in the top layer. Apply a HedgeSlammer to move the fourth corner-cubie from
  the bottom layer into its home position in the top layer. This will also swap two
  diagonal corner-cubies in the top layer.</p>

  <p>Applying a HedgeSlammer to move the fourth corner-cubie to its home position is
  convenient, but not required. Any method can be used to move the four corner-cubies

  their home positions and two diagonal corner-cubies are not in their home
  positions.</p>

  </div>
  <p>There are four corner-cubies in the bottom layer that are not in their home
  positions and they are now ready to be moved to their home positions. Each
  corner-cubie in the bottom layer will be moved to its home position by moving the
  corner-cubie up into the top layer, rotating the top layer, and then moving the
  corner-cubie back down into the bottom layer. Use the following procedure to move the
  four corner-cubies in the bottom layer to their home positions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Recall that HedgeSlammer swaps two corner-cubies along a vertical edge.</li>
    <li>Use HedgeSlammer to move a corner-cubie from the bottom layer into the top
    layer.</li>
    <li>Rotate the top layer until the corner-cubie is directly above its home position
    in the bottom layer.</li>
    <li>Use HedgeSlammer to move the corner-cubie from the top layer into its home
    position in the bottom layer.</li>
    <li>The previous step will have moved a new corner-cubie into the top layer.</li>
    <li>If all corner-cubies in the bottom layer are in their home positions, then STOP,
    otherwise go to step 3.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Once all corner-cubies in the bottom layer have been moved to their home positions,
  examine the four corner-cubies in the top layer. If the four corner-cubies in the top
  layer are not in their home positions, rotate the top layer so that they are.</p>The
  final turn of the top layer in order to return the corner-cubies to their home
  positions only needs to be done if a 'wrong' corner-cubie was moved to the bottom
  layer in Step 2 of the procedure above. If a 'correct' corner-cubie was used in Step
  2, the final turn of the top layer would not be needed. It doesn't matter whether a
  'wrong' or 'correct' corner-cubie was used, because it is trivial to turn the top
  layer, if a 'wrong' corner-cubie was used. (A 'wrong' corner-cubie is either of the
  two corner-cubies that were initially not in their home position in the top layer. )
  <p>For clarity, the example below shows the corner-cubies in the bottom layer oriented
  and in the correct order (relative to each other), but none of the corner-cubies in
  the bottom layer need to be oriented or in the correct order (relative to each
  other).</p>

  <p>When moving corner-cubies in the bottom layer to their home positions, do not
  follow the example above verbatim. The example above only works when all corner-cubies
  in the bottom layer are in order, relative to each other. When a bottom corner-cubie
  is in the top layer, the top layer must be turned so that the corner-cubie is directly
  above its home position in the bottom layer. This will require one or two
  quarter-turns in either direction.</p>

  <p>The task of positioning the eight corner-cubies is now complete. One or more
  (usually many) of the corner-cubies will not be oriented correctly. Orienting the
  corner-cubies will occur in a later stage of the solve.</p>
  <p>The process described above for moving the eight corner-cubies into their home
  positions will always work. If desired, one of two optional variations can be used.
  The advantage of using a variation is that 83% of the time (5 of 6 cases), it will be
  simpler and faster. The disadvantage is that it will not work 17% of the time (1 of 6
  cases).</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Configure the four corner-cubies in the top layer in the usual manner (two
    diagonal corner-cubies in their home positions and two diagonal corner-cubies not in
    their home positions). Once completed, instead of turning the bottom layer so that
    no corner-cubies are in their home position, turn the bottom layer so that exactly
    two corner-cubies are in their home position. This will not be possible in the case
    where all four corner-cubies in the bottom layer are in order, relative to each
    other.</li>
    <li>Instead of configuring the four corner-cubies in the top layer in the usual
    manner (two diagonal corner-cubies in their home positions and two diagonal
    corner-cubies not in their home positions) configure the four corner-cubies in the
    top layer so that they are all in their home positions. If the bottom layer can be
    turned so that all four corner-cubies are in their home positions, then nothing more
    needs to be done. Otherwise, turn the bottom layer so that exactly one corner-cubie
    is in its home position (the other three corner-cubies will necessarily not be in
    their home positions). This will not be possible in the case where the bottom layer
    has two diagonally opposite corner-cubies that are in their home positions and two
    diagonally opposite corner-cubies that are not in their home positions.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>In either case above, move the corner-cubies in the bottom layer to their home
  positions in the usual manner. (i.e. Move the corner-cubie into the top layer using
  HedgeSlammer, then rotate the top layer until it is directly above its home position,
  then use HedgeSlammer to move it into the bottom layer.)</p>
  <h3><a name='positionedges' id="positionedges">Position edge-cubies</a></h3>
  <p>Once all eight corner-cubies have been moved to their home positions, all twelve
  edge-cubies must be moved to their home positions.</p>
  <p>Applying HedgeSlammer swaps two horizontal corner-cubies in the top layer and also
  swaps two vertical corner-cubies. From this, we can deduce that if HedgeSlammer is
  applied two times in a row, both pairs of corner-cubies will swap places a second time
  and be returned to the same position they were at before the first HedgeSlammer was
  applied.</p>

  <p>It does not matter how the cube is oriented, applying HedgeSlammer two times in a
  row always returns all corner-cubies to the same positions they started from.</p>
  <p>From this point forward, <i>always</i> apply HedgeSlammer two times in a row. This
  will ensure that the corner-cubies do not change their positions. After applying
  HedgeSlammer two times in a row, the ending orientation of the corner-cubies will
  differ from their starting orientation, but the orientation of the corner-cubies
  should be ignored.</p>
  <p>For the sake of brevity, applying HedgeSlammer two times in a row will be denoted

  <p>If we examine how applying HedgeSlammer affects edge-cubies, we see that it moves
  three edge-cubies one step counter-clockwise in a three-step cycle. From this, we can
  deduce that if HedgeSlammer is applied three times in a row, the three edge-cubies
  will be returned to their starting position.</p>

  <p>Since we must always apply HedgeSlammer two times in a row it means that each time
  we apply Hs2, the edge-cubies will be moved two steps 'forward' in a counter-clockwise
  direction. Since the edge-cubies move in a three-step cycle, this is the same as
  moving one step 'backwards'. In other words, applying Hs2 causes the edge-cubies to
  move one step clockwise in a three-step cycle.</p>

  <p>When moving edge-cubies to their home positions, do not think of the cube as having
  a fixed orientation. The cube should be freely re-oriented in whatever way is needed
  in order to move edge-cubies to where they need to go. (Do not re-orient the cube
  while applying Hs2, only re-orient the cube after applying Hs2. e.g. Apply Hs2, then
  re-orient, then apply Hs2, then re-orient, then apply Hs2, etc.)</p>
  <p>Do not be concerned about the orientation of the edge-cubies. The edge-cubies only
  need to be moved to their home positions. Orienting the edge-cubies at this stage of
  the solve is optional, but can be done, if desired. Orienting the edge-cubies will be
  done in the next stage of the solve.</p>
  <p>Each layer of the cube has four edge-cubies. When three edge-cubies have been moved
  to their home positions, you will find that it is impossible to move the fourth
  edge-cubie to its home position without dislogding one of the three edge-cubies. There
  are two methods for solving this issue: Pre-staging and Setup-Teardown.</p>
  <p>Pre-staging and Setup-Teardown solve the same problem in different ways. The
  problem and solution is illustrated below.</p>

  <p>There are no restrictions on the moves for the Setup. The Setup can turn any number

  <p>When moving the edge-cubies to their home positions, applying Hs2 caused three
  edge-cubies to move one step clockwise in a three-step cycle. From that fact, we can
  deduce that if Hs2 is applied three times, the three edge-cubies will return to their
  starting positions. It is not so easy to deduce the ending orientations of the
  edge-cubies, but their ending orientations can be discovered by applying Hs2 three
  times in a row and observing how the edge-cubies are affected.</p>
  <p>If Hs2 is applied three times in a row we find that the ending orientations of the
  three edge-cubies exactly matches their starting orientations. Since the edge-cubies
  start and end in the same positions, and since their start and end orientations are
  the same, we can see that applying Hs2 three times in a row accomplishes exactly the
  same thing as doing nothing. (This should not be too much of a surprise since applying
  Hs2 three times is exactly the same as applying HedgeSlammer six times.)</p>
  <p>That discovery is not useful in orienting the edge-cubies, however, if we add a
  <i>pivot</i> to the mix, something useful happens.</p>
  <p>Pivoting the cube clockwise is defined as re-orienting the cube so that the Up face
  becomes the Right face and the Right face becomes the Front face.</p>

  is defined by two corner-cubies. The first corner-cubie is located at the intersection
  of the Front, Right, and Up layers. The second corner-cubie is located at the
  intersection of the Back, Left, and Down layers (which is physically farthest away

  <p>No matter which direction the cube is pivoted (clockwise or counter-clockwise),
  applying Hs2 always and only affects the same seven cubies. And no mater how the cube

  <p>As the nine illustrations above show, no matter which way the cube is pivoted, or
  how often the cube is pivoted, only two outcomes are possible: either two edge-cubies
  will be flipped (on the Up, Front, or Right face) or no changes will occur.</p>
  <p>By flipping two edge-cubies at a time, all edge-cubies can be correctly
  oriented.</p>
  <p>Due to the physical construction of the cube, there is no sequence of turns that
  can ever be devised which will flip exactly one edge-cubie. Edge-cubies can only be
  flipped in pairs. This means that there will always be an even number of edge-cubies
  that must be flipped in order to have all edge-cubies be oriented correctly.</p>
  <p>Of the nine pivot sequences above, eight contain pivots and one contains no pivots.
  As previously discovered, if no pivots are performed then no edge-cubies are flipped.
  Since our goal is to orient edge-cubies by flipping them, we can discard the sequence
  containing no pivots. The remaining eight pivot sequences each contain one or more
  pivots. Of those eight, seven of them flip two edge-cubies and one of them flips no
  edge-cubies.</p>
  <p>What this means is that, as long as you make sure to pivot at least once (and apply
  Hs2 three times), there is a 7/8 = 87.5% chance of flipping two edge-cubies. If you
  happen to apply the pivot sequence that flips no edge-cubies, then the cube will be in
  the same state that it started.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, there is no 'intuitive' way to know which pivot sequence will flip
  which edge-cubies. Here are several options for how to flip two edge-cubies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use knowledge about how Hs2 affects edge-cubies. (See the boxed example below.)
    Each time Hs2 is applied, three edge-cubies move one step clockwise. One edge-cubie
    starts and ends on the Front face; one edge-cubie starts and ends on the Up face;
    one edge-cubie starts and ends on the Right face. The edge-cubies on the Front and
    Right faces 'rotate' about the center-cubie, while the edge-cubie in the Up face
    'flips'. After applying Hs2 twice, examine the edge-cubies. The next (third)
    application of Hs2 will return all three edge-cubies to their home positions. Prior
    to applying Hs2 for the third time, pivot the cube clockwise or counter-clockwise.
    Pivoting changes the Front, Right, and Up faces, and thus controls which two
    edge-cubies are 'rotated' into their home positions and which edge-cubie is
    'flipped' into its home position.</li>
    <li>While solving a cube, try a random pivot sequence and note which two edge-cubies
    flip.
      <ul>
        <li>If you happen to apply the pivot sequence: (Hs2 PivotCounterClockwise Hs2
        PivotCounterClockwise Hs2 PivotCounterClockwise) then no edge-cubies will be
        flipped. This does not move the cube closer to being solved, but neither does it
        undo any progress that has already been made.</li>
        <li>If you happen to apply any of the other seven pivot sequences then two
        edge-cubies will be flipped on the Front, Up, or Right face. You now know a
        pivot sequence that will flip two edge-cubies as well as the face where the
        flipping occurs.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Memorize one of the seven pivot sequences above which flips two edge-cubies.
    Having to memorize an arbitrary pivot sequence goes against the spirit of this
    solution, but will work to orient all the edge-cubies.</li>
    <li>Apply a random pivot sequence. If it does not flip the two desired edge-cubies,
    then repeat the pivot sequence. Repeating a pivot sequence will undo the previous
    pivot sequence. After the cube has been restored, apply a different random pivot
    sequence. If the two desired edge-cubies are still not flipped, repeat the previous
    pivot sequence. Repeating the pivot sequence will undo the previous pivot sequence.
    Continue in this manner until the two desired edge-cubies are flipped. This
    technique is not recommended, but will eventually work.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once you know a pivot sequence that flips two edge-cubies and the face where the
  flipping occurs, the cube can be re-oriented so that any two edge-cubies can be
  flipped.</p>

    <p>If we apply Hs2 for a third time, the three edge-cubies will be returned to their
    starting position and orientation. This is not useful. If we pivot the cube before
    applying the third Hs2, then we know that two edge-cubies will be flipped. However,
    it is not obvious which way to pivot or which edge-cubies will be flipped.</p>

  <p>We also know (or can observe) that each time Hs2 is applied, the corner-cubie in
  the bottom layer is twisted clockwise. And since Hs2 is applied three times, the
  corner-cubie gets twisted clockwise three times. This results in returning the
  corner-cubie to its original orientation. Instead of applying the three clockwise
  twists to a single corner-cubie, the three twists can be applied to two corner-cubies.
  This is accomplished by replacing the original corner-cubie with another
  corner-cubie.</p>

  <p>In the example above, one clockwise twist was applied to the target corner-cubie,
  and two clockwise twists were applied to the replacement corner-cubie. We can use this
  technique to orient all corner-cubies.</p>
  <p>The following procedure can be used to orient all corner-cubies:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Choose a corner-cubie that is already oriented. If needed, use the technique
    above to orient a corner-cubie.</li>
    <li>Find the corner-cubie that is physically farthest away from the chosen oriented
    corner-cubie; this is the Replacement corner-cubie.</li>
    <li>The Replacement corner-cubie will be used for every corner-cubie that needs to
    be oriented.</li>
    <li>For each un-oriented corner-cubie (except the Replacment corner-cubie):
      <ol type='a'>
        <li>Ensure the un-oriented corner-cubie is positioned bottom, right on the Front
        face.</li>
        <li>Ensure the Replacement corner-cubie is in the bottom layer.</li>
        <li>Apply the technique above to twist the un-oriented corner-cubie
        clockwise.</li>
        <li>If the corner-cubie is still not oriented correctly, apply the technique a
        second time.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>The Replacement corner-cubie may start out oriented or un-oriented, and while
  orienting other corner-cubies, the Replacement corner-cubie may switch between being
  oriented and being un-oriented.</p>
  <p>Orienting corner-cubies in the manner described above is effective, but slow. The
  process can be sped up if we are smarter about which corner-cubie is used as a
  replacement and when the replacement is used.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Instead of designating a single corner-cubie as the Replacment, any corner-cubie
    in the bottom layer can be chosen as the replacement.</li>
    <li>Instead of twisting an un-oriented corner-cubie once and then twisting the
    replacement corner-cubie twice, the un-oriented corner-cubie can be twisted twice
    and the replacement twisted once.</li>
    <li>Instead of using one replacement corner-cubie, two replacement corner-cubies can
    be used. By doing so, it is sometimes possible to orient three corner-cubies at a
    time.</li>

  <p>In general, the steps for orienting a corner-cubie are:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Apply Hs2 until the corner-cubie in the bottom layer is oriented (this will
    always require applying Hs2 either once or twice).</li>
    <li>Then replace the oriented corner-cubie (by turning the bottom layer),</li>
    <li>Then apply Hs2 until the top and middle layers are restored (the replacement
    corner-cubie may still be un-oriented).</li>
    <li>Then un-turn the bottom layer (which returns all corner-cubies to their home
    positions).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The process described above for orienting corner-cubies is simple, but somewhat
  laborious. A common technique that other solutions use to orient corner-cubies in the
  top layer is <a href='soln-cube-alt.html#rdrd'>(R' D' R D)</a>. You may prefer using
  it over using Hs2 to orient corner-cubies.</p>
