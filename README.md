# Solving twisty polyhedra

This repository contains:

* Twiddler, a single-file app for manipulating virtual polyhedrons in any browser
* A method for solving a 3x3x3 cube
* A method for solving a tetrahedron of any size
* A method for solving a hexahedron (cube) of any size
* A method for solving a octahedron of any size
* A method for solving a dodecahedron of any size

Two Javascript libraries are used to illustrate the solving process.

* twedra.js, a (50Kb) Javascript library that can animate twisty-puzzle polyhedras
* jjcube.js, a Javascript library for drawing static images of a 3x3x3 cube

More info is available in [here](./docs/index.html).


# Building

Building will create the twedra.js library and, optionally, minify it. The jjcube.js library is never minified. The Twiddler app and HTML solution files are generated by embedding or linking to the Javascript libraries.

    ./build.sh help         Show help info
    ./build.sh clean        Delete the Build directory
    ./build.sh  [ min | med | max ]   [ ref | emb ]
        min    Minifies the Javascript sources using the <a href='https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler'>Closure compiler</a>.
        med    Minifies the Javascript source files by removing whitespace. 
        max    Concatenates the Javascript source files.

        ref   Adds a reference to the Javascript libraries in the HTML files
        emb   Embeds the Javascript libraries in the HTML files

The Twiddler app is always built by embedding the Javascript libraries in the HTML file.
